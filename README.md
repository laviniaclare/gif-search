# Simple Gif Search

This is a simple web app that allows a user to search for and view gifs

## Getting Started

To get started, first clone or fork this repo. It's a good idea to set up a virtual environment with Python 3 to run this in. You can find instructions for setting that up here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html

### Prerequisites

The required packages are listed in requirements.txt. You can install them by running the following command in your terminal (make sure your virtual environment is activated first, if you are using one):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the app

To start the app run the following command in your terminal:

```
python routes.py
```

You can then navigate the app by visiting http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser. You can use search for gifs using the (very) simple form and the app will automatically display them
